 branching of the Pywallet of "Jackjack"

I had the problem of recovering the bitcoins of a Bitcoin-QT wallet encrypted by a password.
I kept a backup of the wallet and the password with which I had encrypted.
Because of my ignorance I could not recover the bitcoins stored there.
Using an electrum-3.3.8 wallet (which allowed me not to download the whole blockchain with Bitcoin core QT) I could load there about 4000 private keys that were originally contained in my wallet. So I transferred the funds to another wallet. To do this, I had to modify jackjack's original pywallet. That's all. I hope it can serve someone like it served me.
